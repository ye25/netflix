## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




PART 1: Data Management
1)  Load the rating data into R and save as a data frame. Rename the columns "1",..,"5" as "Rocky1",.,"Rocky5"
```{import data}

library(readr)
rockyDB <- read_csv("C:/Users/lnaye/Desktop/R/Marketing Analytics/rockyDB.csv")

names(rockyDB)[2] <- "rocky1"
names(rockyDB)[3] <- "rocky2"
names(rockyDB)[4] <- "rocky3"
names(rockyDB)[5] <- "rocky4"
names(rockyDB)[6] <- "rocky5"

```

b) The problem with 0 values is that when comparing the ratings for each movie. The algorithm of calculating mean, median, and even standard deviation would consider 0 as the lowest rating instead of NA value. For example, suppose rocky5 is a unpopular but highly-rated movie, putting 0 instead of null will misrepresent rocky5 to be low rated movie. 

c) Replace 0 with NA
```{r}
rockyDB[rockyDB==0] <- NA
```



PART 2: Data Exploration and Missing Data

a) Compare the correlations between the ratings of each of the five movies using the cor command on your new data frame. Which movies are most similar? Which movie is most different from the others? Put the matrix of correlations and your response in the
document. 

Rocky3 are most similar with orthers. Its correlation wit rocky1, rocky2, rocky4 and rocky5 are 0.54, 0.75, 0.73, abd 0.59, which all of them are relatively high in the matrix. Rocky1 is most differenct than others because its average correlation with others is the lowest across all five movies. 

```{r}
library(corrplot)
library(gplots)
rockyDB_corr <- subset(rockyDB,select = -c(1))

cor <- cor(rockyDB_corr,use="complete.obs")

corrplot::corrplot.mixed(corr=cor,tl.pos="lt")


```


b) Find the mean rating of each movie. Which is the best? Which is the worst? Answer in the document
```{r}
means <- colMeans(rockyDB[,2:6],na.rm = TRUE)

print(round(means,digit=4))
```

c)Create a subset of your data frame that only contains consumers who rated Rocky 4. Find the mean rating of each movie in the data set. Compare with the results of the previous section. Why do you think the mean ratings changed? Answer in the
document.
```{r}

rockyDB_valid4 <- subset(rockyDB, !is.na(rocky4))

print(colMeans(rockyDB[,2:6],na.rm = TRUE))
print(colMeans(rockyDB_valid4[,2:6],na.rm = TRUE))


```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
